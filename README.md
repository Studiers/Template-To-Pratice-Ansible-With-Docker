[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Studiers/Template-To-Pratice-Ansible-With-Docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Studiers/Template-To-Pratice-Ansible-With-Docker)

## Introduction

Finding a physical metal-bare server or creating an environment with vms is a real pain.  
So I developed this to be lazy!

## How to use

Just run this shell script

```/bin/bash
./start-ansible
```

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#upgrade-path)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
